# Data Science Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

## Overview

This repository contains Python notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using various techniques, including univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and the use of Pandas Profiling. 
This repository also contains basic understanding of the question which we should know before analysing the data. The purpose of this EDA is to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and make informed decisions for subsequent steps in the data science workflow.

## Notebooks


### 1. Basic Questions of Data
    1. How big the data is?
    2. How does the data look like? (Sample)
    3. What is the data type of cols?
    4. How many null values/missing values are there
    5. How does the data look mathematically?
    6. Are there duplicate values?
    7. How is the correlation between cols?

### 2. Univariate Analysis

#### Description:

Univariate analysis focuses on examining one variable at a time. This notebook explores key statistical measures, visualizations, and insights derived from individual variables within the dataset.

#### Techniques Used:
- Categorical Data : Count Plot , Pie Chart
- Numerical Data   : Histogram , Dist Plot , Box Plot
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
- Key findings and observations

#### Notebook: [Univariate_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/gtanish2003/Data-Science/blob/master/Data%20Understamding/UnivariateAnalysis.ipynb)

### 3. Multivariate Analysis

#### Description:

Multivariate analysis involves examining the relationships between multiple variables in the dataset. This notebook explores correlations, patterns, and dependencies between different variables.

#### Techniques Used

- Scatter Plot (Numerical - Numerical)
- Bar Plot (Numerical - Categorical)
- Box Plot(Numerical - Categorical)
- Displot (Numerical- Categorical)
- Heat Map (Categorical-Categorical)
- Cluster map(Categorical-Categorical)
- Pair Plot
-  Line plot
Line plot is a special case of scatter plot which is used when we have time or date related items on x-axis..It is also used for numerical-numerical data..

### 4. Pandas Profiling

#### Description:

Pandas Profiling is a tool that generates an overview report of a dataset, providing a quick and convenient way to understand the data's structure, patterns, and basic statistics.

#### Techniques Used:

- Generating Pandas Profiling reports
- Analyzing data overview, statistics, and correlations
- Identifying missing values and data types
